# Talone

# The purpose of this app is to enable people in communities who have things, and people who need things, to connect anonymously
# The backend will know users by their email (used to register), a unique handle they create, and a unique ID created by the backend

# Design Logic:
# Some gestures are so ingrained in the psyches of iPhone users, that I intend to take advantage of this intuitive understanding as much as possible
# The Dashboard will be available from every screen in the app (some exceptions may apply)
# The user's first thought about how to do something, or simple discovery through casual use, dictate the fundamental design pattern
# New ideas merit further exploration, but new software packages should be viewed with a skeptical eye

# NEED

# A need may be searched for and created from the same screen
# When a Need is found that matches search criteria, a user may join that Need
# When a Have is found that matches search criteria, a user may join that Have -- 
#      - User will be prompted to enter a description, and a need will be created and linked to the Have
# When a need is created, a user may connect it to a Have -- mechanism still in design phase --

# HAVE

# EVENT

# The owner of a Have may create an Event, and link related Haves, and/or related Needs
# Events will have a notification mechanism to alert all parties when created
