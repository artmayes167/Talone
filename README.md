< Note: The file structure is in flux, because I am working on defining an organic flow for engineers.  If that doesn't make sense to you, that's fine.  This is all a work in progress.>

The purpose of this app is to enable people in communities who have things, and people who need things, to connect anonymously
The backend will know users by their email (used to register), a unique handle they create, and a unique ID created by the backend.

As events unfold, I want to keep feedback open, so that self-defining communities can name themselves.  Those names would then become options under (or in addition to) city

# Design Logic:
- Some gestures are so ingrained in the psyches of iPhone users, that I intend to take advantage of this intuitive understanding as much as possible
- The Dashboard will be available from every main screen in the app, once main flow is entered
- The user's first thought about how to do something, or simple discovery through casual use, dictate the fundamental design pattern
- New ideas merit further exploration, but new software packages should be viewed with a skeptical eye

# NEED & HAVE:
- A need or have may be searched for or created
- When a Need is found that matches search criteria, a user may watch that Need
- When a Have is found that matches search criteria, a user may watch that Have

Known Issues:
- If the project stops recognizing Firebase (including Auth), see: https://github.com/firebase/firebase-ios-sdk/issues/6066#issuecomment-662580211
