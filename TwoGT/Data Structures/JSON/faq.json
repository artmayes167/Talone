        "question": "what is talone?",
        "answer": "Talone is, simply, a lightsaber for community organization entrepreneurs. Which is to say, it's a magical tool, it's a little dangerous, and it can change according to your needs.\n\nit's also a framework for recognizing and allocating resources.\n\nit currently contains an engine for creating and matching needs; a rating engine, balanced to account for potential trolling; and a private, encrypted messaging system. you can ask me to build whatever you want around these core tools, and potentially have them in your hands in a few days. As a founder, you can shape it to suit your needs by providing feedback."
    }, {
        "question": "what does 'Talone' mean?",
        "answer": "Talone is 'together' and 'alone' combined into a word that could mean 'dragon's claw'. our archetypes have not been kind to dragons-- they're basically fire-breathing billionaires who eat virgins.\n\nbut maybe we can imagine ourselves as noble dragons- as collectors and protectors- and take steps to bring people together. to reimagine power not as something our future robot overlords will wield over us, but as something that springs from us, and should work for us.\n\nand maybe this app can grow with us, as we learn what that power actually means, and how to use it."

        "question": "what am i doing?",
        "answer": "think about a time when you needed something, and had no one to reach out to. think about having a group of people who were responsive to those needs. \n\nfrom that simple idea, this engine could be used to \n1) issue community alerts for neighbors; \n2) manage grocery stock based on community needs; \n3) enhance word-of-mouth business for solo repair people; \nor find a babysitter in the neighborhood."
    }, {
        "question": "how do i invite people?",
        "answer": "in the dashboard, there's an 'invite a tester' screen. go there. all you need is an email, and a name. but make sure they have an iPhone before you invite them. \npost-testing, this will likely become a direct email invite."
    }, {
        "question": "why now?",
        "answer": "the pandemic, and coming social, environmental, and political disasters are going to test the idea of what community means. a lot of us are going to find our lives and relationships in turmoil, surrounded by essentially vagrant communities, with few ties, and fewer people to lean on. \n\nthis is an app confronting that truth, and the disassociation, solitude, rootlessness, and novel interdependency that entails. \n\nwe are all facing a new frontier that none of us knows how to manage. this app is an ambitious attempt to give you a voice in how that plays out. \n\nwe're all in this together, but we're all facing it alone."

        "question": "when should I provide feedback?",
        "answer": "whenever you think 'I wish it could...'"
