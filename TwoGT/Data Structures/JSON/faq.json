        "question": "what is talone?",
        "answer": "Talone is, simply, an engine for allocating resources. \n\nit currently contains an engine for creating and matching needs; a rating engine, balanced to account for potential trolling; and a private, encrypted messaging system. \nfuture plans include an internal VOIP to shield shared phone numbers, and an internal mail mechanism to preserve anonymity. \n\nIt focuses on the core relationship we all have with each other: satisfying needs. \n\nThis is not an app, so much as a seed. As a founder, you can shape it to suit your needs by providing feedback."

        "question": "what am i doing?",
        "answer": "think about a time when you needed something, and had no one to reach out to. think about having a group of people who were responsive to those needs. \n\nfrom that simple idea, this engine could be used to \n1) handle parts priorities in manufacturing; \n2) manage grocery stock based on community needs; \n3) enhance word-of-mouth business for solo repair people; \nor find a babysitter in the neighborhood."
    },{
        "question": "how do i invite people?",
        "answer": "in the dashboard, there's an 'invite a tester' screen. go there. all you need is an email, and a name. but mention it to them before you invite them. \npost-testing, this will likely become a direct email invite."

        "question": "what does 'Talone' mean?",
        "answer": "Talone is 'together' and 'alone' combined into a word that could mean 'dragon's claw'. i would like to eventually build this out to include a variety of real-life gamification techniques, which would mimic the functionality of a role-playing game, but with real life. \n\ni'll totally do that, but not yet."
    },{
        "question": "why now?",
        "answer": "the pandemic, and coming social, environmental, and political disasters are going to test the idea of what community means. a lot of us are going to find our lives and relationships in turmoil, surrounded by essentially vagrant communities, with few ties, and fewer people to lean on. \n\nthis is an app confronting that truth, and the disassociation, solitude, rootlessness, and novel interdependency that entails. \n\nwe are all facing a new frontier that none of us knows how to manage. this app is an ambitious attempt to give you a voice in how that plays out. \n\nwe're all in this together, but we're all facing it alone."

        "question": "when should I provide feedback?",
        "answer": "whenever you think 'I wish it could...'"
