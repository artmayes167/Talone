        "answer": "You are a dragon. your objective is to create a community that attracts people, and builds relationships that make your hoard stronger.\n\nyou begin at level one with access to a single empty horde.  you may name it and invite people.  as you level up, new options will become available."

        "question": "how do i invite people?",
        "answer": "initially, the mechanics work like sending a card with an invitation. at later levels, you can set membership and validation requirements, among other things."

        "question": "what are the rules governing my hoard?",
        "answer": "part of what makes this 'game' unique, is that you don't choose a ready-made system, you build one piece-by-piece. you don't start as a 'Democracy', you build what you think a democracy should look like. as you build, you'll see how each piece works, and make up your own rules for dealing with it.\n\nlike Sid Meyer's Civilization, IRL."

        "summary": "When you have a shiny new hammer, every problem looks like a nail-- including kittens. All tech we create will be abused. That's how we find its strengths and weaknesses. and sometimes the abuses become the main focus, and we lose sight of other possibilities.\n\ni think we took a wrong turn somewhere down the line.\n\nin order to figure out where, we need to look at our basic assumptions about what society means, and whether tech supports it in the right way."

        "topic": "the consumer app",
        "summary": "When Apple invented the idea of the app, they created an Undiscovered Country. They didn't know what could be built, so they made a sandbox, opensourced the sand, and an ecosystem was born.\n\nApps grew like weeds, fighting for food- in the beginning, it was straightforward. they clung to the feeding model of their ancestors: money for services or products. then google and facebook made everything free, if you gave them you. then they sold you, in bunches or individually, on the open market like bunded stocks. if not your data, then your eyes on advertising.\n\napps evolved into parasites and scavengers, feeding off the refuse of our consumption. everything about them is created for that specific purpose."

        "topic": "Big E",
        "summary": "Big E Enterprise is the enterprise word for company. i know that, because i lived in that world for a while. they do a lot right, and a lot wrong. but big ships adjust slowly, and pay millions of dollars to ensure they don't have to change course.\n\none of the things they aspire to do well is connect and enable consistent relationships between people with common goals. those apps aren't available to community groups, or that local corner grocery store that refuses to die, but can't quite live."

        "topic": "Highly Relevant Philosophical Interlude",
        "summary": "Descartes (Day-CART) figured that, in order to understand himself, he needed to look hard at every assumption he ever made. This led to a process of discovery we now reduce to 'i think, therefor i am'.\n\nso what assumptions have we made about apps, and how have those assumptions shaped their evolution? is there anything to gain by reimagining the app development process- not as an imposition of structure- but as a discovery of process? I'm betting there is.\n\nand if we can do that with apps, maybe we can do it with our fundamental assumptions about community, too."

        "topic": "you are your community",
        "summary": "You define yourself by your belonging to some community, if you're lucky, and/or by your hatred of some other community. community used to mean neighborhoods and local grocers, community squares and faces you knew. values you knew, and private beliefs you politely ignored.\n\nnow we struggle to see our own face in any crowd, and feel the weight of isolation while browsing earth-shattering fantasies. our culture is hidden from us by monolithic stories of good and evil that blind us with graven images of truth, without reminding us of what that truth means.\n\ni'll wait while you dig out your Constitution, or look up a meaningful definition of 'freedom'. wink wink, nudge nudge. don't forget to vote."

        "topic": "beginning",
        "summary": "At some point, humans decided that building a circle of fire in the dark forest was easier when you had someone watching your back. and once that fire was established, whoever controlled it controlled the group that gathered around it for warmth and protection. they decided who was cast out, and they made the rules for who was allowed to stay.\n\nbut there were many fires, and many rules. and as the circles expanded, they met, and war came."
    },{
        "topic": "caste",
        "summary": "After developing the technology of 'society', we realized it would take some work to keep going. one idea was a caste system-- essentially putting people in little boxes, like self-replacing gears. if one generation of workers dies off, they have trained their children as replacement parts.\n\nConfuscianism, an early thought-experiment in social engineering, attained religious status. Hinduism was apparently started by blue aliens who dish out social status as a reward for past-life behavior (a stunning example of mass manipulation). most new technologies have a few religions attached-- the guy who developed the Pythagorean Theorum became the leader of a sex cult that hated beans. That's right: math used to be hot tech."
