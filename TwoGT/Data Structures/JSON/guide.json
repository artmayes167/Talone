        "question": "how do i invite people?",
        "answer": "initially, the mechanics work like sending a card with an invitation. at later levels, you can set membership and validation requirements, among other things."
    },{
        "question": "what are the rules governing my hoard?",
        "answer": "part of what makes this 'game' unique, is that you don't choose a ready-made system, you build one piece-by-piece. you don't start as a 'Democracy', you build what you think a democracy should look like. as you build, you'll see how each piece works, and make up your own rules for dealing with it.\n\nlike Sid Meyer's Civilization, IRL."
