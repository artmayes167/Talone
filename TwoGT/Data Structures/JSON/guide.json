        "question": "how do i invite people?",
        "answer": "initially, the mechanics work like sending a card with an invitation. at later levels, you can set membership and validation requirements, among other things."

        "question": "what are the rules governing my hoard?",
        "answer": "part of what makes this 'game' unique, is that you don't choose a ready-made system, you build one piece-by-piece. you don't start as a 'Democracy', you build what you think a democracy should look like. as you build, you'll see how each piece works, and make up your own rules for dealing with it.\n\nlike Sid Meyer's Civilization, IRL."

        "summary": "At some point, humans decided that building a circle of fire in the dark forest was easier when you had someone watching your back. and once that fire was established, whoever controlled it controlled the group that gathered around it for warmth and protection. they decided who was cast out, and they made the rules for who was allowed to stay.\n\nbut there were many fires, and many rules. and as the circles expanded, they met, and war came."

        "topic": "caste",
        "summary": "After developing the technology of 'society', we realized it would take some work to keep going. one idea was a caste system-- essentially putting people in little boxes, like self-replacing gears. if one generation of workers dies off, they have trained their children as replacement parts.\n\nConfuscianism, an early thought-experiment in social engineering, attained religious status. Hinduism was apparently started by blue aliens who dish out social status as a reward for past-life behavior (a stunning example of mass manipulation). most new technologies have a few religions attached-- the guy who developed the Pythagorean Theorum became the leader of a sex cult that hated beans. That's right: math used to be hot tech."
