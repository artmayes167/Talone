        "question": "what am i doing?",
        "answer": "you are establishing a community of people local to you, with common interests. one example might be a group of local musicians who need to set up a gear-sharing community. another is a small local shop with a localized customer base that uses the community to help the shopkeep stock what the community wants. or a condominium association with limited living space, sharing a ladder large enough to reach the lights 12 feet off the floor. the app will grow according to how it is used. so start a community and invite your acquaintances."
    },{
        "question": "how do i invite people?",

    },{
        "question": "how does that mean something?",
        "answer": "the pandemic, and coming social, environmental, and political disasters are going to test the american idea of what community means. this is an american app, confronting the american experience of disassociation, solitude, independence, and transactional friendship. american culture idolizes the frontiersman. and we are all facing a new frontier that none of us knows how to manage. this app is an ambitious attempt to give you a voice in how that plays out. we're all in this together, but we're all facing it alone."
